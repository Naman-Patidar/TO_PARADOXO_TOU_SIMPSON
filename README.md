# TO PARADOXO TOU SIMPSON
## SIMPSON'S PARADOX:WHEN STATISTICS  DEFIES COMMON SENSE 

Lets dive back in time to 1711.

You are standing in middle of The Great War of Mathematics(Lets assume you wont get hit by raining  arrows of logic or attacked by razor sharp deductions ) fought between two contemporary nemesis of each other- Newton and Leibniz.
Both had enormous army of axioms and theorems.Have you ever wondered how an real battlefield of mathematics would have looked like.If not ,Lets do it today .Since chiildhood I wanted to have a hypothesis in my name , guess what ,i came with following nonsensical one .....emoji......

From now  your journey in my hypothetical world begins......

Let us  visualise axioms to be infantrymen  and the theorems to be cavalry.Newton  had a rich army of fearless infantry and cavalry say N<SUB>i</SUB>  and N<SUB>c</SUB> respectively . Leibniz's army was no less heroic having brave  infantry and cavalry say L<sub>i</sub> and L<sub>c</sub>.
The war raged across the battlefield for 7 years.

>_"Obviously, the greater the length of a war the higher is likely to be the number of casualties in it on either side."_

Enough philosophy for the time being but the truth is both the  Armies suffered huge losses.
As a renowned mathematician in my hypothetical world,I must analyse a puzzling statistic of the great war.Look at the graph below.

_**The front that suffered fewer casualities was victorious.**_

**Which side do you think suffered greater casualities ?**

Most of you would have guessed Newton suffered more casualities just because both infantry and cavalry had higher casuality percentage.


**But Newton did not lose!!!!**


I myself was shaken by this truth but had to believe it when I saw the  overall data.Those still skeptical of my words, glance through the following graph.

 >_"Overall casuality rate of Newton could
 be less than that of Leibniz if at least one of the Newton's regiment's casuality rate had been less than that of Leibniz . There was no way that the weighted average of casuality rates could show such contrary results."_

>**Simpson’s paradox says
 however that this can occur; it is possible for any relation between two variables to be reversed
 in every component subpopulation**

I would like you  to give yourself a minute to think where the anomaly lies in our common senses.


Meanwhile Let us explore the demographics of both the armies.

Notice the stark difference between the two armies. After seeing these pie charts, the whole paradox dissolved to mere ignorance of **_confounding variables_** to me. Do you get it ?Let me explain  it to you .


>What are confounding variables?

>Confounding variables are those that affect other variables in a way that produces spurious or distorted associations between two variables. 

Earlier we were missing a crucial variable that is ,the composition of army.If we incorporate the effect of it ,it turns out that we have a very intuitive explanation of Simplson's Pardox encountered before.

## WAS IT REALLY A PARADOX ?

Although Newton's infantry had higher casuality rate than Leibniz's, But infantry constituted just 20 % of Newton's Army.In other words , almost all soldiers in infantry regiment died but , there were not many soldiers in that regiment to begin with !
On the other hand, Leibniz's Army had a very high percentage of infantry with a very high casuality rate about 50 % !So,larger  proportion of infantry along with higher casuality rate was enough to push the overall casuality rate to the  extent where it exceeds Newton's Army's casuality rate .

Lets put the Mathematics going behind in front of you.


From the graphs, the following observations are very straightforward:

+ Casuality rate of Newton's Infantry = C.R.<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub> = 80%
+ Casuality rate of Newton's Cavalry = C.R.<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>=25%<br>

<br>


+ Percentage of infantry in Newton's  Army= P<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>=20%
+ Percentage of cavalry in Newton's Army =P<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>=80%


<br>

+ Casuality rate of Leibniz's Infantry = C.R.<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub> = 50%
+ Casuality rate of Leibniz's Cavalry = C.R.<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>=20%

<br>

+ Percentage of infantry in Leibniz's  Army= P<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub>=80%
+ Percentage of cavalry in Leibniz's Army =P<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>=20%



#### **Overall casuality rate of Newton's Army = (C.R.<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>\* P<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>) + ( C.R.<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>\* P<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>) = _80% \* 20% +25% \* 80% = 36%_**




#### **Overall casuality rate of Leibniz's Army = (C.R.<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub>\* P<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub>) + ( C.R.<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>\* P<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>) = _50% \* 80% +20% \* 20% = 44%_**

<!-- 

(Casuality rate of infantry ) \* (Percentage of infantry in Army)+(Casuality rate of cavalry)\*(Percentage of cavalry in Army)=** -->


And you see the mathematical results are consistent with the [fig_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e9980b-b348-4fae-985c-fd65bae891a2) .
