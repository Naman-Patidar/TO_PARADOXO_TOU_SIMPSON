# SIMPSON'S PARADOX : WHEN STATISTICS  DEFY COMMON SENSE 










## The Great War of Mathematics  

Letâ€™s journey back in time to the year **1711**.  

You find yourself in the midst of **The Great War of Mathematics**, a fierce intellectual battle fought between two legendary nemeses: **Isaac Newton** and **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**. Donâ€™t worryâ€”youâ€™re perfectly safe here (no arrows of logic or razor-sharp deductions will harm you).  

Both titans wield armies of unimaginable power, consisting of **axioms** and **theorems**, ready to clash for mathematical supremacy. Have you ever wondered what a true battlefield of mathematics might look like? If not, letâ€™s imagine it today!  

Since childhood, Iâ€™ve dreamed of having a hypothesis named after me. Guess what? Iâ€™ve concocted this completely nonsensical one  here ðŸ˜….  

<!-- From this point on, your journey into my hypothetical world begins...   -->

With that, I invite you to embark on a journey through my hypothetical world, where math is not just theoryâ€”itâ€™s warfare.

## The Setup  

- **Axioms** are like fearless infantry, forming the foundation of the army.  
- **Theorems** are the cavalry, swift and powerful, riding in to secure victory.  

Newtonâ€™s army boasts a formidable force of infantry  N<sub>i</sub> and cavalry  N<sub>c</sub>. Meanwhile, Leibnizâ€™s troops are equally valiant, with infantry  L<sub>i</sub> and cavalry  L<sub>c</sub>.  

The battlefield is set. The war rages on for **five long years**, filled with intellectual maneuvers, strategic deductions, and battles of wits.

<!-- 
Enough philosophy for the time being but the truth is both the  Armies suffered huge losses.

The brutal truth is that both armies suffered tremendous losses over the course of the war. 
<!-- The toll of this conflict, while intellectual in nature, came at a heavy price. -->

As a renowned mathematician in my hypothetical world, I must now turn my attention to a puzzling statistic from this great war. Letâ€™s take a closer look at the graph below, where we begin to unravel the mystery of the devastating losses sustained by both sides in this epic battle of ideas.

<!-- 
_**The front that suffered fewer casualties was victorious.**_

**Which side do you think suffered greater casualties ?**

Most of you would have guessed Newton suffered more casualties just because both infantry and cavalry had higher casualty percentage.


**But Newton did not lose!!!!**


I myself was shaken by this truth but had to believe it when I saw the  overall data.Those still skeptical of my words, glance through the following graph.

<!-- Here's a revised and dramatic continuation of your article: -->

##  **The front that suffered fewer casualties was victorious.**

**Which side do you think suffered greater casualties?**

Many of you might assume that Newton's side took the brunt of the losses, especially since both his infantry and cavalry suffered a higher percentage of casualties. The evidence seems clearâ€”Newtonâ€™s forces appeared to be in far worse shape.

**But Newton did not lose!!!!**

This revelation struck me like a thunderclap. I, too, was shaken by the truth of it. Yet, the data does not lie. When I examined the overall statistics, the outcome was irrefutable. Those still skeptical of my words, I invite you to glance through the following graph.

 >_"Overall casualty rate of Newton could
 be less than that of Leibniz if at least one of the Newton's regiment's casualty rate had been less than that of Leibniz . There was no way that the weighted average of casualty rates could show such contrary results."_

<!-- - Common Sense** -->




<!-- 
I would like you  to give yourself a minute to think where the anomaly lies in our common senses.


Meanwhile Let us explore the demographics of both the armies. -->


Now, I ask you to take a moment and reflect on where the anomaly might lie. Why does our common sense seem to betray us? How could Newtonâ€™s side, despite higher casualties in both infantry and cavalry, emerge victorious?

The timing is perfect for a revelation!

Brace yourselfâ€”hereâ€™s the formal definition of Simpson's Paradox:
<br>
### **Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.**

While you ponder this, let us dive deeper into the demographics of both armies. Understanding the makeup of _Newton_ and _Leibnizâ€™s_ forces may provide the key to unraveling this perplexing paradox.

Notice the stark difference between the two armies. After seeing these pie charts, the whole paradox dissolved to mere ignorance of **_confounding variables_** to me. Do you get it ?Let me explain  it to you .


>What are confounding variables?

>Confounding variables are those that affect other variables in a way that produces spurious or distorted associations between two variables. 

Earlier we were missing a crucial variable that is ,the composition of army.If we incorporate the effect of it ,it turns out that we have a very intuitive explanation of Simplson's Pardox encountered before. -->



Notice the stark difference between the two armies. After examining these pie charts, the entire paradox unraveled before my eyes, reducing itself to nothing more than a simple oversightâ€”confounding variables. Do you see it? Let me explain.

<!-- What are confounding variables? -->

>**Confounding variables** are factors that influence other variables in such a way that they create misleading or distorted associations between them.

Earlier, we failed to account for a crucial variable: the composition of the army. Once we incorporate the effect of this, the mystery dissolves, and we arrive at a remarkably intuitive explanation for the Simpsonâ€™s Paradox we encountered earlier.

## WAS IT REALLY A PARADOX ?




Although Newton's infantry suffered a higher casualty rate than Leibniz's, it made up only 20% of Newton's army. In other words, while nearly all soldiers in Newton's infantry regiment perished, the regiment itself was relatively small. 

In contrast, Leibniz's army had a much larger proportion of infantry, with a significant casualty rate of around 50%. This combination of a larger infantry proportion and a higher casualty rate contributed to the overall casualty rate of Leibniz's army surpassing that of Newton's.

Lets put the Mathematics going behind in front of you.


From the graphs, the following observations are very straightforward:

+ casualty rate of _Newton's_ Infantry :<br> **C.R.<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub> = _80%_**
+ casualty rate of _Newton's_ Cavalry :<br> **C.R.<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>=_25%_**<br>

<br>


+ Percentage of infantry in _Newton's_  Army: <br>**P<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>=_20%_**
+ Percentage of cavalry in _Newton's_ Army :<br> **P<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>=_80%_**

<br>


#### **Overall casualty rate of Newton's Army = (C.R.<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>x P<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>) + ( C.R.<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>x P<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>) = _(80% x 20%) +(25% x 80%) = 36%_**

<br>

+ casualty rate of _Leibniz's_ Infantry :<br> **C.R.<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub> = _50%_**
+ casualty rate of _Leibniz's_ Cavalry :<br> **C.R.<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>=_20%_**

<br>

+ Percentage of infantry in _Leibniz's_  Army:<br> **P<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub>=_80%_**
+ Percentage of cavalry in _Leibniz's_ Army :<br> **P<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>=_20%_**

<br>




#### **Overall casualty rate of Leibniz's Army = (C.R.<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub> x  P<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub>) + ( C.R.<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub> x P<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>) = _(50% x 80%) +(20% x 20% )= 44%_**

<!-- 

(casualty rate of infantry ) \* (Percentage of infantry in Army)+(casualty rate of cavalry)\*(Percentage of cavalry in Army)=** -->
<br>

And you see, the mathematical results are consistent with the [figure 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e9980b-b348-4fae-985c-fd65bae891a2) .




 >_**If data can be partitioned in such a way that a single Simpson's reversal emerges, then, logically, it seems inevitable that this reversal will continue as the data is divided even further.**_

This very phenomenon is vividly illustrated in Figure 3, where the casualty rates of four distinct military units are laid bare: Infantry I (the swordsmen of the first battalion), Infantry II (the archers of the second battalion), Cavalry I (the nimble, lightly armored cavalry), and Cavalry II (the mighty, heavily armored cavalry). With this partitioning, the data splits into four subsets, each telling its own tale. In every single one, Leibniz's battalion suffers greater casualties than Newton'sâ€”at least, that's what the numbers suggest.

<br>
<br>
Yet, as we zoom out and aggregate the data to the level of regiments, the tides begin to shift, and we encounter Figure 1. Here, a stunning reversal occursâ€”Leibniz's army now appears to have outperformed Newton's! But the twists do not end there. As we continue to aggregate the data, adding more layers, the final conclusion arrives, and once again, itâ€™s Newtonâ€™s army that emerges victorious considering the  overall casualty rate.


>**_Simpsonâ€™s paradox_ says
 however that this can occur; it is possible for any relation between two variables to be reversed
 in every component subpopulation**
<!-- Time is perfect to give you the formal definition for simpson's paradox. -->



This chain of reversals begs the ultimate question: **Which army truly proved superior?**

<!-- I provide you with even detailed demographics of both the armies and leave it up to you to verify the trend reversal we just saw. -->
I now present you with even more detailed demographics of both armies and leave it to you to verify the trend reversal weâ€™ve just witnessed.

Do you want to hear one more truth?

**Newton** and **Leibniz** never participated in any actual wars. While their intellectual battle over the discovery of calculus is legendary, they never fought on a physical battlefield. This fact serves as a powerful reminder to snap us out of the hypothetical world we've been exploring.

**Now, we must return to reality**. Itâ€™s time to set aside our imaginative scenarios and consider the true implications of Simpsonâ€™s Paradox. You might be wondering:
 **How does Simpsonâ€™s Paradox manifest itself in the real world?**

**Do  still you believe the statistical phenomenon described above should be considered a paradox?**

>Mathematician **Jordan Ellenberg** argues that Simpson's paradox is misnamed as **"there's no contradiction involved, just two different ways to think about the same data"** and suggests that its lesson **"isn't really to tell us which viewpoint to take but to insist that we keep both the parts and the whole in mind at once."**

Although criticized, Simpson's paradox remains a fascinating and frequently explored topic in statistics and data analysis. Its ongoing study across diverse disciplines highlights the importance of nuanced statistical methods and the dangers of oversimplifying data interpretations.
